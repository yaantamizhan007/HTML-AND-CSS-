What is an HTML Element?
•An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

•<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
•The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

•<h1>My First Heading</h1>
•<p>My first paragraph.</p>

 
         
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none

WEB BROWSERS. 
•The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

•A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

•View in Browser
